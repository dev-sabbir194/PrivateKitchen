## Tell us the differences between uncontrolled and controlled components.?

Uncontrolled components are those where form data is handled by the DOM, while controlled components are those where form data is handled by React state. In uncontrolled components, the data is handled directly by the DOM using refs, while in controlled components, the data is handled by React state and passed down as props to child components. Uncontrolled components are typically easier to implement, while controlled components provide more flexibility and validation.

##  How to validate React props using PropTypes?
PropTypes is a type-checking library for React props. By using PropTypes, you can specify the type and shape of the props that a component expects. To use PropTypes, you simply import the library and add a static propTypes property to your component class. This property should be an object that specifies the type of each prop. PropTypes will then check the type of each prop at runtime and throw an error if the type doesn't match.

## Tell us the difference between nodejs and express js.?
Node.js is a runtime environment for running JavaScript on the server, while Express.js is a web framework built on top of Node.js. Node.js provides the platform for running server-side code, while Express.js provides the tools for building web applications, handling HTTP requests, and routing. In other words, Node.js is the foundation, while Express.js is the building blocks.

## What is a custom hook, and why will you create a custom hook?
A custom hook is a reusable function that contains some stateful logic and can be shared across multiple components. Custom hooks are useful for abstracting away complex logic and creating a modular codebase. You can create a custom hook whenever you find yourself repeating the same logic across multiple components, or when you want to encapsulate some functionality within a single function. By creating a custom hook, you can reduce the amount of code you need to write and make your code more readable and maintainable.
